Error:
------

error when starting a container.

"lxc-start Invalid argument"

"lxc-execute -n foo -f /usr/local/etc/lxc/lxc-macvlan.conf /bin/bash"
"[syserr] lxc_start:96: Invalid argument - failed to fork into a new
namespace"

Answer:
-------

read the lxc man page about kernel version prereq :) most probably
your kernel is not configured to support the container options you
want to use.


Error:
------

On Ubuntu 8.10, if using the cvs source code rather than
the provided tarball. Then make is failing with many errors
similar to the line below:
==========
../../libtool: line 810: X--tag=CC: command not found
==========

Answer:
-------

This is related to a compatibility problem between the shipped
config/ltmain.sh and the libtool version installed on your
Ubuntu 8.10 machine.
You have to replace the config/ltmain.sh from cvs head by the one
from your libtool package, make some cleaning and reissue all
the build process:
==========
cd <your_lxc_working_dir>
cp -f /usr/share/libtool/config/ltmain.sh config/
rm -f libtool
./bootstrap && ./configure && make && sudo make install
==========
