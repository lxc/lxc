    <title>Description</title>

    <para>
      LXC is the well-known and heavily tested low-level Linux container
      runtime. It is in active development since 2008 and has proven itself in
      critical production environments world-wide. Some of its core contributors
      are the same people that helped to implement various well-known
      containerization features inside the Linux kernel.
    </para>

    <para>
      LXC's main focus is system containers. That is, containers which offer an
      environment as close as possible as the one you'd get from a VM but
      without the overhead that comes with running a separate kernel and
      simulating all the hardware.
    </para>

    <para>
      This is achieved through a combination of kernel security features such as
      namespaces, mandatory access control and control groups.
    </para>

    <para>
      LXC has support for unprivileged containers.  Unprivileged containers are
      containers that are run without any privilege.  This requires support for
      user namespaces in the kernel that the container is run on.  LXC was the
      first runtime to support unprivileged containers after user namespaces
      were merged into the mainline kernel.
    </para>

    <para>
      In essence, user namespaces isolate given sets of UIDs and GIDs. This is
      achieved by establishing a mapping between a range of UIDs and GIDs on the
      host to a different (unprivileged) range of UIDs and GIDs in the
      container. The kernel will translate this mapping in such a way that
      inside the container all UIDs and GIDs appear as you would expect from the
      host whereas on the host these UIDs and GIDs are in fact unprivileged. For
      example, a process running as UID and GID 0 inside the container might
      appear as UID and GID 100000 on the host.  The implementation and working
      details can be gathered from the corresponding user namespace man page.
      UID and GID mappings can be defined with the <option>lxc.idmap</option>
      key.
    </para>

    <para>
      Linux containers are defined with a simple configuration file.  Each
      option in the configuration file has the form <command>key =
      value</command> fitting in one line. The "#" character means the line is a
      comment. List options, like capabilities and cgroups options, can be used
      with no value to clear any previously defined values of that option.
      </para>

    <para>
      LXC namespaces configuration keys use single dots. This means complex
      configuration keys such as <option>lxc.net.0</option> expose various
      subkeys such as <option>lxc.net.0.type</option>,
      <option>lxc.net.0.link</option>, <option>lxc.net.0.ipv6.address</option>, and
      others for even more fine-grained configuration.
    </para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <para>
        In order to ease administration of multiple related containers, it is
        possible to have a container configuration file cause another file to be
        loaded. For instance, network configuration can be defined in one common
        file which is included by multiple containers. Then, if the containers
        are moved to another host, only one file may need to be updated.
      </para>

          <term>
            <option>lxc.include</option>
          </term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Specify the file to be included.  The included file must be
              in the same valid lxc configuration file format.

    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Architecture</title>
      <para>
        Allows one to set the architecture for the container. For example, set a
        32bits architecture for a container running 32bits binaries on a 64bits
        host. This fixes the container scripts which rely on the architecture to
        do some work like downloading the packages.

      <title>Hostname</title>
      <para>
        The utsname section defines the hostname to be set for the container.
        That means the container can set its own hostname without changing the
        one from the system. That makes the hostname private for the container.

    <refsect2>
      <title>Halt signal</title>
      <para>
        Allows one to specify signal name or number sent to the container's
        init process to cleanly shutdown the container. Different init systems
        could use different signals to perform clean shutdown sequence. This
        option allows the signal to be specified in kill(1) fashion, e.g.
        SIGPWR, SIGRTMIN+14, SIGRTMAX-10 or plain number. The default signal is
        SIGPWR.

    <refsect2>
      <title>Reboot signal</title>
      <para>
        Allows one to specify signal name or number to reboot the container.
        This option allows signal to be specified in kill(1) fashion, e.g.
        SIGTERM, SIGRTMIN+14, SIGRTMAX-10 or plain number. The default signal
        is SIGINT.

    <refsect2>
      <title>Stop signal</title>
      <para>
        Allows one to specify signal name or number to forcibly shutdown the
        container. This option allows signal to be specified in kill(1) fashion,
        e.g. SIGKILL, SIGRTMIN+14, SIGRTMAX-10 or plain number.  The default
        signal is SIGKILL.

        Sets the UID/GID to use for the init system, and subsequent commands.
        Note that using a non-root UID when booting a system container will
        likely not work due to missing privileges. Setting the UID/GID is mostly
        useful when running application containers.

      <title>Network</title>
      <para>
        The network section defines how the network is virtualized in
        the container. The network virtualization acts at layer
        two. In order to use the network virtualization, parameters
        must be specified to define the network interfaces of the
        container. Several virtual interfaces can be assigned and used
        in a container even if the system has only one physical
        network interface.

            <para>
              specify what kind of network virtualization to be used
              for the container.
              Multiple networks can be specified by using an additional index
              <option>i</option>
              after all <option>lxc.net.*</option> keys. For example,
              <option>lxc.net.0.type = veth</option> and
              <option>lxc.net.1.type = veth</option> specify two different
              networks of the same type. All keys sharing the same index
              <option>i</option> will be treated as belonging to the same
              network. For example, <option>lxc.net.0.link = br0</option>
              will belong to <option>lxc.net.0.type</option>.
              Currently, the different virtualization types can be:
            </para>

            <para>
              <option>none:</option> will cause the container to share
              the host's network namespace.  This means the host
              network devices are usable in the container.  It also
              means that if both the container and host have upstart as
              init, 'halt' in a container (for instance) will shut down the
              host. Note that unprivileged containers do not work with this
	      setting due to an inability to mount sysfs. An unsafe workaround
	      would be to bind mount the host's sysfs.
            </para>

            <para>
              <option>empty:</option> will create only the loopback
              interface.
            </para>

            <para>
              <option>veth:</option> a virtual ethernet pair
              device is created with one side assigned to the container
              and the other side attached to a bridge specified by
              the <option>lxc.net.[i].link</option> option.
              If the bridge is not specified, then the veth pair device
              will be created but not attached to any bridge.
              Otherwise, the bridge has to be created on the system
              before starting the container.
              <command>lxc</command> won't handle any
              configuration outside of the container.
              By default, <command>lxc</command> chooses a name for the
              network device belonging to the outside of the
              container, but if you wish to handle
              this name yourselves, you can tell <command>lxc</command>
              to set a specific name with
              the <option>lxc.net.[i].veth.pair</option> option (except for
              unprivileged containers where this option is ignored for security
              reasons).

              the container. The vlan identifier is specified with the

            </para>

            <para>
              <option>macvlan:</option> a macvlan interface is linked
              with the interface specified by
              the <option>lxc.net.[i].link</option> and assigned to
              the container.
              <option>lxc.net.[i].macvlan.mode</option> specifies the
              mode the macvlan will use to communicate between
              different macvlan on the same upper device. The accepted
              modes are <option>private</option>, <option>vepa</option>,
              <option>bridge</option> and <option>passthru</option>.
	      In <option>private</option> mode, the device never
              communicates with any other device on the same upper_dev (default).
              In <option>vepa</option> mode, the new Virtual Ethernet Port
              Aggregator (VEPA) mode, it assumes that the adjacent
              bridge returns all frames where both source and
              destination are local to the macvlan port, i.e. the
              bridge is set up as a reflective relay.  Broadcast
              frames coming in from the upper_dev get flooded to all
              macvlan interfaces in VEPA mode, local frames are not
              delivered locally. In <option>bridge</option> mode, it
              provides the behavior of a simple bridge between
              different macvlan interfaces on the same port. Frames
              from one interface to another one get delivered directly
              and are not sent out externally. Broadcast frames get
              flooded to all other bridge ports and to the external
              interface, but when they come back from a reflective
              relay, we don't deliver them again.  Since we know all
              the MAC addresses, the macvlan bridge mode does not
              require learning or STP like the bridge module does. In

            <para>
            Setting this option instructs liblxc to allocate an in-memory
            ringbuffer. The container's console output will be written to the
            ringbuffer. Note that ringbuffer must be at least as big as a
            standard page size. When passed a value smaller than a single page
            size liblxc will allocate a ringbuffer of a single page size. A page
            size is usually 4KB.

            The keyword 'auto' will cause liblxc to allocate a ringbuffer of
            128KB.

            When manually specifying a size for the ringbuffer the value should
            be a power of 2 when converted to bytes. Valid size prefixes are
            'KB', 'MB', 'GB'. (Note that all conversions are based on multiples
            of 1024. That means 'KB' == 'KiB', 'MB' == 'MiB', 'GB' == 'GiB'.
            Additionally, the case of the suffix is ignored, i.e. 'kB', 'KB' and
            'Kb' are treated equally.)

            must be at least as big as a standard page size. When passed a value
            smaller than a single page size liblxc will set the size of log file
            to a single page size. A page size is usually 4KB.

            The keyword 'auto' will cause liblxc to place a limit of 128KB on

              Users wishing to prevent the console log file from filling the

              This is dangerous when the container has write access to the

      <title>Console through the ttys</title>
      <para>
        This option is useful if the container is configured with a root
        filesystem and the inittab file is setup to launch a getty on the
        ttys. The option specifies the number of ttys to be available for
        the container. The number of gettys in the inittab file of the
        container should not be greater than the number of ttys        specified
        in this option, otherwise the excess getty sessions will die and
        respawn indefinitely giving annoying messages on the console or in
        <filename>/var/log/messages</filename>.

      <title>Console devices location</title>
      <para>
        LXC consoles are provided through Unix98 PTYs created on the
        host and bind-mounted over the expected devices in the container.
        By default, they are bind-mounted over <filename>/dev/console</filename>
        and <filename>/dev/ttyN</filename>.  This can prevent package upgrades
        in the guest.  Therefore you can specify a directory location (under
        <filename>/dev</filename> under which LXC will create the files and
        bind-mount over them.  These will then be symbolically linked to
        <filename>/dev/console</filename> and <filename>/dev/ttyN</filename>.
        A package upgrade can then succeed as it is able to remove and replace
        the symbolic links.

      <title>/dev directory</title>
      <para>
        By default, lxc creates a few symbolic links (fd,stdin,stdout,stderr)
        in the container's <filename>/dev</filename> directory but does not
        automatically create device node entries. This allows the container's
        <filename>/dev</filename> to be set up as needed in the container
        rootfs.  If lxc.autodev is set to 1, then after mounting the container's
        rootfs LXC will mount a fresh tmpfs under <filename>/dev</filename>
        (limited to 500k) and fill in a minimal set of initial devices.
        This is generally required when starting a container containing
        a "systemd" based "init" but may be optional at other times.  Additional
        devices in the containers /dev directory may be created through the
        use of the <option>lxc.hook.autodev</option> hook.

      <title>Mount points</title>
      <para>
        The mount points section specifies the different places to be
        mounted. These mount points will be private to the container
        and won't be visible by the processes running outside of the
        container. This is useful to mount /etc, /var or /home for
        examples.
      </para>
      <para>
	NOTE - LXC will generally ensure that mount targets and relative
	bind-mount sources are properly confined under the container
	root, to avoid attacks involving over-mounting host directories
	and files.  (Symbolic links in absolute mount sources are ignored)
	However, if the container configuration first mounts a directory which
	is under the control of the container user, such as /home/joe, into
        the container at some <filename>path</filename>, and then mounts
        under <filename>path</filename>, then a TOCTTOU attack would be
        possible where the container user modifies a symbolic link under
        his home directory at just the right time.

        If lxc was compiled and installed with SELinux support, and the host
        system has SELinux enabled, then the SELinux context under which the
        container should be run can be specified in the container
        configuration.  The default is <command>unconfined_t</command>,
        which means that lxc will not attempt to change contexts.

      <title>Seccomp configuration</title>
      <para>
        A container can be started with a reduced set of available
        system calls by loading a seccomp profile at startup.  The
        seccomp configuration file must begin with a version number
        on the first line, a policy type on the second line, followed
        by the configuration.
      </para>
      <para>
        Versions 1 and 2 are currently supported.  In version 1, the
        policy is a simple whitelist.  The second line therefore must
        read "whitelist", with the rest of the file containing one (numeric)
        syscall number per line.  Each syscall number is whitelisted,
        while every unlisted number is blacklisted for use in the container
      </para>

      <para>
       In version 2, the policy may be blacklist or whitelist,
       supports per-rule and per-policy default actions, and supports
       per-architecture system call resolution from textual names.

        A container can be started in a private user namespace with

        0 in the container to userid 200000 on the host.  The root
        user in the container will be privileged in the container,
        but unprivileged on the host.  Normally a system container
        will want a range of ids, so you would map, for instance,
        user and group ids 0 through 20,000 in the container to the
        ids 200,000 through 220,000.

      <title>Container hooks</title>
      <para>
        Container hooks are programs or scripts which can be executed
        at various times in a container's lifetime.
      </para>
      <para>
        When a container hook is executed, additional information is passed
        along. The <option>lxc.hook.version</option> argument can be used to
        determine if the following arguments are passed as command line
        arguments or through environment variables. The arguments are:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para> Container name. </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para> Section (always 'lxc'). </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para> The hook type (i.e. 'clone' or 'pre-mount'). </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para> Additional arguments. In the
          case of the clone hook, any extra arguments passed will appear as
          further arguments to the hook.  In the case of the stop hook, paths to
          filedescriptors for each of the container's namespaces along with
          their types are passed. </para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        The following environment variables are set:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para> LXC_CGNS_AWARE: indicator whether the container is
          cgroup namespace aware. </para></listitem>

          is set to 1 then LXC_HOOK_TYPE will be set.
          </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para> LXC_HOOK_SECTION: the section type (e.g. 'lxc',

          is set to 1 then LXC_HOOK_SECTION will be set.
          </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para> LXC_HOOK_VERSION: the version of the hooks. This
          value is identical to the value of the container's
          <option>lxc.hook.version</option> config item. If it is set to 0 then
          old-style hooks are used. If it is set to 1 then new-style hooks are
          used. </para></listitem>
          <listitem><para> LXC_LOG_LEVEL: the container's log level. </para></listitem>

          environment variable. These environment variables will only be set if

            To pass the arguments in new style via environment variables set to
            1 otherwise set to 0 to pass them as arguments.
            This setting affects all hooks arguments that were traditionally
            passed as arguments to the script. Specifically, it affects the
            container name, section (e.g. 'lxc', 'net') and hook type (e.g.
            'clone', 'mount', 'pre-mount') arguments. If new-style hooks are
            used then the arguments will be available as environment variables.
            The container name will be set in LXC_NAME. (This is set
            independently of the value used for this config item.) The section
            will be set in LXC_HOOK_SECTION and the hook type will be set in
            LXC_HOOK_TYPE.
            It also affects how the paths to file descriptors referring to the
            container's namespaces are passed. If set to 1 then for each
            namespace a separate environment variable LXC_[NAMESPACE
            IDENTIFIER]_NS will be set. If set to 0 then the paths will be
            passed as arguments to the stop hook.

    <title>Logging</title>
    <para>
      Logging can be configured on a per-container basis.  By default,
      depending upon how the lxc package was compiled, container startup
      is logged only at the ERROR level, and logged to a file named after
      the container (with '.log' appended) either under the container path,
      or under @LOGPATH@.
    </para>
    <para>
      Both the default log level and the log file can be specified in the
      container configuration file, overriding the default behavior.  Note
      that the configuration file entries can in turn be overridden by the
      command line options to <command>lxc-start</command>.

            The level at which to log.  The log level is an integer in
            the range of 0..8 inclusive, where a lower number means more
            verbose debugging.  In particular 0 = trace, 1 = debug, 2 =
            info, 3 = notice, 4 = warn, 5 = error, 6 = critical, 7 =
            alert, and 8 = fatal.  If unspecified, the level defaults
            to 5 (error), so that only errors and above are logged.

    <title>Autostart and System Boot</title>
    <para>
          Each container can be part of any number of groups or no group at all.
          Two groups are special. One is the NULL group, i.e. the container does
          not belong to any group. The other group is the "onboot" group.
    </para>

    <para>
          When the system boots with the LXC service enabled, it will first
          attempt to boot any containers with lxc.start.auto == 1 that is a member
          of the "onboot" group. The startup will be in order of lxc.start.order.
          If an lxc.start.delay has been specified, that delay will be honored
          before attempting to start the next container to give the current
          container time to begin initialization and reduce overloading the host
          system. After starting the members of the "onboot" group, the LXC system
          will proceed to boot containers with lxc.start.auto == 1 which are not
          members of any group (the NULL group) and proceed as with the onboot
          group.

      <title>Container Environment</title>

        If you want to pass environment variables into the container (that
        is, environment variables which will be available to init and all of
        its descendents), you can use <command>lxc.environment</command>
        parameters to do so.  Be careful that you do not pass in anything
        sensitive; any process in the container which doesn't have its
        environment scrubbed will have these variables available to it, and
        environment variables are always available via
        <command>/proc/PID/environ</command>.
      </para>

        This configuration parameter can be specified multiple times; once
