    <title>Description</title>

    <para>
      The linux containers (<command>lxc</command>) are always created
      before being used. This creation defines a set of system
      resources to be virtualized / isolated when a process is using
      the container. By default, the pids, sysv ipc and mount points
      are virtualized and isolated. The other system resources are
      shared across containers, until they are explicitly defined in
      the configuration file. For example, if there is no network
      configuration, the network will be shared between the creator of
      the container and the container itself, but if the network is
      specified, a new network stack is created for the container and
      the container can no longer use the network of its ancestor.
    </para>

    <para>
      The configuration file defines the different system resources to
      be assigned for the container. At present, the utsname, the
      network, the mount points, the root file system, the user namespace,
      and the control groups are supported.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each option in the configuration file has the form <command>key
      = value</command> fitting in one line. The '#' character means
      the line is a comment. List options, like capabilities and cgroups
      options, can be used with no value to clear any previously
      defined values of that option.
    </para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <para>
        In order to ease administration of multiple related containers, it
        is possible to have a container configuration file cause another
        file to be loaded.  For instance, network configuration
        can be defined in one common file which is included by multiple
        containers.  Then, if the containers are moved to another host,
        only one file may need to be updated.
      </para>

          <listitem>
            <para>
              Specify the file to be included.  The included file must be
              in the same valid lxc configuration file format.

    <refsect2>
      <title>Architecture</title>
      <para>
        Allows one to set the architecture for the container. For example,
        set a 32bits architecture for a container running 32bits
        binaries on a 64bits host. This fixes the container scripts
        which rely on the architecture to do some work like
        downloading the packages.

      <title>Hostname</title>
      <para>
        The utsname section defines the hostname to be set for the
        container. That means the container can set its own hostname
        without changing the one from the system. That makes the
        hostname private for the container.

      <title>Halt signal</title>
      <para>
        Allows one to specify signal name or number, sent by lxc-stop to the
        container's init process to cleanly shutdown the container. Different
        init systems could use different signals to perform clean shutdown
        sequence. This option allows the signal to be specified in kill(1)
        fashion, e.g. SIGPWR, SIGRTMIN+14, SIGRTMAX-10 or plain number. The
        default signal is SIGPWR.

      <title>Reboot signal</title>
      <para>
        Allows one to specify signal name or number, sent by lxc-stop to
        reboot the container. This option allows signal to be specified in
        kill(1) fashion, e.g. SIGTERM, SIGRTMIN+14, SIGRTMAX-10 or plain number.
        The default signal is SIGINT.

      <title>Stop signal</title>
      <para>
        Allows one to specify signal name or number, sent by lxc-stop to forcibly
        shutdown the container. This option allows signal to be specified in
        kill(1) fashion, e.g. SIGKILL, SIGRTMIN+14, SIGRTMAX-10 or plain number.
        The default signal is SIGKILL.

      <title>Network</title>
      <para>
        The network section defines how the network is virtualized in
        the container. The network virtualization acts at layer
        two. In order to use the network virtualization, parameters
        must be specified to define the network interfaces of the
        container. Several virtual interfaces can be assigned and used
        in a container even if the system has only one physical
        network interface.

            <para>
              specify what kind of network virtualization to be used
              for the container. Each time
              a <option>lxc.network.type</option> field is found a new
              round of network configuration begins. In this way,
              several network virtualization types can be specified
              for the same container, as well as assigning several
              network interfaces for one container. The different
              virtualization types can be:
            </para>

            <para>
              <option>none:</option> will cause the container to share
              the host's network namespace.  This means the host
              network devices are usable in the container.  It also
              means that if both the container and host have upstart as
              init, 'halt' in a container (for instance) will shut down the
              host.
            </para>

            <para>
              <option>empty:</option> will create only the loopback
              interface.
            </para>

            <para>
              <option>veth:</option> a virtual ethernet pair
              device is created with one side assigned to the container
              and the other side attached to a bridge specified by
              the <option>lxc.network.link</option> option.
              If the bridge is not specified, then the veth pair device
              will be created but not attached to any bridge.
              Otherwise, the bridge has to be created on the system
              before starting the container.
              <command>lxc</command> won't handle any
              configuration outside of the container.
              By default, <command>lxc</command> chooses a name for the
              network device belonging to the outside of the
              container, but if you wish to handle
              this name yourselves, you can tell <command>lxc</command>
              to set a specific name with
              the <option>lxc.network.veth.pair</option> option (except for
              unprivileged containers where this option is ignored for security
              reasons).
            </para>

            <para>
              <option>vlan:</option> a vlan interface is linked with
              the interface specified by
              the <option>lxc.network.link</option> and assigned to
              the container. The vlan identifier is specified with the
              option <option>lxc.network.vlan.id</option>.
            </para>

            <para>
              <option>macvlan:</option> a macvlan interface is linked
              with the interface specified by
              the <option>lxc.network.link</option> and assigned to
              the container.
              <option>lxc.network.macvlan.mode</option> specifies the
              mode the macvlan will use to communicate between
              different macvlan on the same upper device. The accepted
              modes are <option>private</option>, <option>vepa</option>,
              <option>bridge</option> and <option>passthru</option>.
	      In <option>private</option> mode, the device never
              communicates with any other device on the same upper_dev (default).
              In <option>vepa</option> mode, the new Virtual Ethernet Port
              Aggregator (VEPA) mode, it assumes that the adjacent
              bridge returns all frames where both source and
              destination are local to the macvlan port, i.e. the
              bridge is set up as a reflective relay.  Broadcast
              frames coming in from the upper_dev get flooded to all
              macvlan interfaces in VEPA mode, local frames are not
              delivered locally. In <option>bridge</option> mode, it
              provides the behavior of a simple bridge between
              different macvlan interfaces on the same port. Frames
              from one interface to another one get delivered directly
              and are not sent out externally. Broadcast frames get
              flooded to all other bridge ports and to the external
              interface, but when they come back from a reflective
              relay, we don't deliver them again.  Since we know all
              the MAC addresses, the macvlan bridge mode does not
              require learning or STP like the bridge module does. In
              <option>passthru</option> mode, all frames received by
              the physical interface are forwarded to the macvlan
              interface. Only one macvlan interface in <option>passthru</option>
              mode is possible for one physical interface.

      <para>
        LXC consoles are provided through Unix98 PTYs created on the

        By default, they are bind-mounted over <filename>/dev/console</filename>
        and <filename>/dev/ttyN</filename>.  This can prevent package upgrades
        in the guest.  Therefore you can specify a directory location (under
        <filename>/dev</filename> under which LXC will create the files and
        bind-mount over them.  These will then be symbolically linked to
        <filename>/dev/console</filename> and <filename>/dev/ttyN</filename>.
        A package upgrade can then succeed as it is able to remove and replace
        the symbolic links.

      <title>/dev directory</title>
      <para>
        By default, lxc creates a few symbolic links (fd,stdin,stdout,stderr)
        in the container's <filename>/dev</filename> directory but does not
        automatically create device node entries. This allows the container's
        <filename>/dev</filename> to be set up as needed in the container
        rootfs.  If lxc.autodev is set to 1, then after mounting the container's
        rootfs LXC will mount a fresh tmpfs under <filename>/dev</filename>
        (limited to 500k) and fill in a minimal set of initial devices.
        This is generally required when starting a container containing
        a "systemd" based "init" but may be optional at other times.  Additional
        devices in the containers /dev directory may be created through the
        use of the <option>lxc.hook.autodev</option> hook.

        The mount points section specifies the different places to be

        and won't be visible by the processes running outside of the
        container. This is useful to mount /etc, /var or /home for
        examples.
      </para>
      <para>
	NOTE - LXC will generally ensure that mount targets and relative
	bind-mount sources are properly confined under the container
	root, to avoid attacks involving over-mounting host directories
	and files.  (Symbolic links in absolute mount sources are ignored)
	However, if the container configuration first mounts a directory which
	is under the control of the container user, such as /home/joe, into
        the container at some <filename>path</filename>, and then mounts
        under <filename>path</filename>, then a TOCTTOU attack would be
        possible where the container user modifies a symbolic link under
        his home directory at just the right time.

              Apparmor profiles are pathname based.  Therefore many file

              a determined attacker.  However, these mount restrictions are not
              yet implemented in the upstream kernel.  Without the mount
              restrictions, the apparmor profiles still protect against accidental
              damager.

        Versions 1 and 2 are currently supported.  In version 1, the

              done in this hook will not be reflected on the host (apart from
              mounts propagation), so they will be automatically cleaned up
              when the container shuts down.

      Logging can be configured on a per-container basis.  By default,
      depending upon how the lxc package was compiled, container startup
      is logged only at the ERROR level, and logged to a file named after
      the container (with '.log' appended) either under the container path,
      or under @LOGPATH@.
    </para>
    <para>
      Both the default log level and the log file can be specified in the
      container configuration file, overriding the default behavior.  Note
      that the configuration file entries can in turn be overridden by the

            The level at which to log.  The log level is an integer in

            info, 3 = notice, 4 = warn, 5 = error, 6 = critical, 7 =
            alert, and 8 = fatal.  If unspecified, the level defaults

    <para>
          Each container can be part of any number of groups or no group at all.
          Two groups are special. One is the NULL group, i.e. the container does
          not belong to any group. The other group is the "onboot" group.
    </para>

    <para>
          When the system boots with the LXC service enabled, it will first
          attempt to boot any containers with lxc.start.auto == 1 that is a member
          of the "onboot" group. The startup will be in order of lxc.start.order.
          If an lxc.start.delay has been specified, that delay will be honored
          before attempting to start the next container to give the current
          container time to begin initialization and reduce overloading the host
          system. After starting the members of the "onboot" group, the LXC system
          will proceed to boot containers with lxc.start.auto == 1 which are not
          members of any group (the NULL group) and proceed as with the onboot
          group.

        If you want to pass environment variables into the container (that

        parameters to do so.  Be careful that you do not pass in anything
        sensitive; any process in the container which doesn't have its
        environment scrubbed will have these variables available to it, and
        environment variables are always available via
        <command>/proc/PID/environ</command>.

      <title>Network</title>
      <para>This configuration sets up a container to use a veth pair
        device with one side plugged to a bridge br0 (which has been
        configured before on the system by the administrator). The
        virtual network device visible in the container is renamed to
        eth0.</para>

      <title>Control group</title>
      <para>This configuration will setup several control groups for
      the application, cpuset.cpus restricts usage of the defined cpu,
      cpus.share prioritize the control group, devices.allow makes
      usable the specified devices.</para>
