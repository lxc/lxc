    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      The container technology is actively being pushed into the mainstream
      Linux kernel. It provides resource management through control groups and
      resource isolation via namespaces.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>lxc</command>, aims to use these new functionalities to provide a
      userspace container object which provides full resource isolation and
      resource control for an applications or a full system.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>lxc</command> is small enough to easily manage a container with
      simple command lines and complete enough to be used for other purposes.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Requirements</title>
    <para>
      The kernel version >= 3.10 shipped with the distros, will work with
      <command>lxc</command>, this one will have less functionalities but enough
      to be interesting.
    </para>
       
    <para>
      <command>lxc</command> relies on a set of functionalities provided by the
      kernel. The helper script <command>lxc-checkconfig</command> will give
      you information about your kernel configuration, required, and missing
      features.
    </para>

    <title>Functional specification</title>
    <para>
      A container is an object isolating some resources of the host, for the
      application or system running in it.
    </para>
    <para>
      The application / system will be launched inside a container specified by
      a configuration that is either initially created or passed as a parameter
      of the commands.
    </para>

    <para>How to run an application in a container</para>
    <para>
      Before running an application, you should know what are the resources you
      want to isolate. The default configuration is to isolate PIDs, the sysv
      IPC and mount points. If you want to run a simple shell inside a
      container, a basic configuration is needed, especially if you want to
      share the rootfs. If you want to run an application like
      <command>sshd</command>, you should provide a new network stack and a new
      hostname. If you want to avoid conflicts with some files eg.
      <filename>/var/run/httpd.pid</filename>, you should remount
      <filename>/var/run</filename> with an empty directory. If you want to
      avoid the conflicts in all the cases, you can specify a rootfs for the
      container. The rootfs can be a directory tree, previously bind mounted
      with the initial rootfs, so you can still use your distro but with your
      own <filename>/etc</filename> and <filename>/home</filename>
    </para>
    <para>
      Here is an example of directory tree
      for <command>sshd</command>:
      <programlisting>	
[root@lxc sshd]$ tree -d rootfs
	
rootfs	
|-- bin	
|-- dev	
|   |-- pts
|   `-- shm
|       `-- network
|-- etc	
|   `-- ssh
|-- lib	
|-- proc
|-- root
|-- sbin
|-- sys	
|-- usr	
`-- var	
    |-- empty
    |   `-- sshd
    |-- lib
    |   `-- empty
    |       `-- sshd
    `-- run
        `-- sshd
      </programlisting>

      and the mount points file associated with it:
      <programlisting>
	[root@lxc sshd]$ cat fstab

	/lib /home/root/sshd/rootfs/lib none ro,bind 0 0
	/bin /home/root/sshd/rootfs/bin none ro,bind 0 0
	/usr /home/root/sshd/rootfs/usr none ro,bind 0 0
	/sbin /home/root/sshd/rootfs/sbin none ro,bind 0 0
      </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>How to run a system in a container</para>

    <para>
    Running a system inside a container is paradoxically easier
    than running an application. Why? Because you don't have to care
    about the resources to be isolated, everything needs to be
    isolated, the other resources are specified as being isolated but
    without configuration because the container will set them
    up. eg. the ipv4 address will be setup by the system container
    init scripts. Here is an example of the mount points file:
    </para>

      <programlisting>
	[root@lxc debian]$ cat fstab

	/dev	/home/root/debian/rootfs/dev none bind 0 0
	/dev/pts /home/root/debian/rootfs/dev/pts  none bind 0 0
      </programlisting>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Container life cycle</title>
      <para>
	When the container is created, it contains the configuration
	information. When a process is launched, the container will be starting
	and running. When the last process running inside the container exits,
	the container is stopped.
      </para>
      <para>
	In case of failure when the container is initialized, it will pass
	through the aborting state.
      </para>

      <title>Configuration</title>
      <para>The container is configured through a configuration
      file, the format of the configuration file is described in
      <citerefentry>

      <title>Unprivileged containers</title>
      <para>
        Unprivileged LXC containers run without root host-level privileges in a 
        user namespace, mapping container UID 0 to a non-root host ID, which 
        strictly limits the accessible devices and filesystems of the 
        container. In order to mount a rootfs in an unprivileged container, the 
        mapped host user must have execute permissions for all directories 
        along the path to and including the rootfs. Additionally, all files and 
        directories under the rootfs must be owned by the correct user ID and 
        group ID. The correct user ID and group ID are the host IDs mapped to 
        the container root(UID 0) in lxc.idmap.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Creating / Destroying containers</title>
      <para>
	A persistent container object can be created via the
	<command>lxc-create</command> command. It takes a container name as
	parameter and optional configuration file and template. The name is
	used by the different commands to refer to this container. The
	<command>lxc-destroy</command> command will destroy the container
	object.
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-create -n foo
	  lxc-destroy -n foo
	</programlisting>
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
	<title>Volatile container</title>
	<para>
	  It is not mandatory to create a container object before starting it.
	  The container can be directly started with a configuration file as
	  parameter.
	</para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Starting / Stopping container</title>
      <para>
	When the container has been created, it is ready to run an application /
	system.  This is the purpose of the <command>lxc-execute</command> and
	<command>lxc-start</command> commands.  If the container was not created
	before starting the application, the container will use the
	configuration file passed as parameter to the command, and if there is
	no such parameter either, then it will use a default isolation.  If the
	application ended, the container will be stopped, but if needed the
	<command>lxc-stop</command> command can be used to stop the container.
      </para>

      <para>
	Running an application inside a container is not exactly the same thing
	as running a system. For this reason, there are two different commands
	to run an application into a container:
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-execute -n foo [-f config] /bin/bash
	  lxc-start -n foo [-f config] [/bin/bash]
	</programlisting>
      </para>

      <para>
	The <command>lxc-execute</command> command will run the specified command
	into a container via an intermediate process,
	<command>lxc-init</command>.
	This lxc-init after launching  the specified command, will wait for its
	end and all other reparented processes.  (to support daemons in the
	container).  In other words, in the container,
	<command>lxc-init</command> has PID 1 and the first process of the
	application has PID 2.
      </para>

      <para>
	The <command>lxc-start</command> command will directly run the specified
	command in the container. The PID of the first process is 1. If no
	command is specified <command>lxc-start</command> will run the command
	defined in lxc.init.cmd or if not set, <filename>/sbin/init</filename> .
      </para>

      <para>
	To summarize, <command>lxc-execute</command> is for running an
	application and <command>lxc-start</command> is better suited for
	running a system.
      </para>

      <para>
	If the application is no longer responding, is inaccessible or is not
	able to finish by itself, a wild <command>lxc-stop</command> command
	will kill all the processes in the container without pity.
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-stop -n foo -k
	</programlisting>
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Connect to an available tty</title>
      <para>
	If the container is configured with ttys, it is possible to access it
	through them. It is up to the container to provide a set of available
	ttys to be used by the following command. When the tty is lost, it is
	possible to reconnect to it without login again.
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-console -n foo -t 3
	</programlisting>
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Freeze / Unfreeze container</title>
      <para>
	Sometime, it is useful to stop all the processes belonging to
	a container, eg. for job scheduling. The commands:
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-freeze -n foo
	</programlisting>

	will put all the processes in an uninteruptible state and

	<programlisting>
	  lxc-unfreeze -n foo
	</programlisting>

	will resume them.
      </para>

      <para>
	This feature is enabled if the freezer cgroup v1 controller is enabled
	in the kernel.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Getting information about container</title>
      <para>
      When there are a lot of containers, it is hard to follow what has been
      created or destroyed, what is running or what are the PIDs running in a
      specific container. For this reason, the following commands may be useful:
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-ls -f
	  lxc-info -n foo
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	<command>lxc-ls</command> lists containers.
      </para>

      <para>
	<command>lxc-info</command> gives information for a specific container.
      </para>

      <para>
	Here is an example on how the combination of these commands
	allows one to list all the containers and retrieve their state.
	<programlisting>
	  for i in $(lxc-ls -1); do
	    lxc-info -n $i
	  done
	</programlisting>
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Monitoring container</title>
      <para>
	It is sometime useful to track the states of a container, for example to
	monitor it or just to wait for a specific state in a script.
      </para>

      <para>
	<command>lxc-monitor</command> command will monitor one or several
	containers. The parameter of this command accepts a regular expression
	for example:
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-monitor -n "foo|bar"
	</programlisting>
	will monitor the states of containers named 'foo' and 'bar', and:
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-monitor -n ".*"
	</programlisting>
	will monitor all the containers.
      </para>
      <para>
	For a container 'foo' starting, doing some work and exiting,
	the output will be in the form:
	<programlisting>
	  'foo' changed state to [STARTING]
	  'foo' changed state to [RUNNING]
	  'foo' changed state to [STOPPING]
	  'foo' changed state to [STOPPED]
	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	<command>lxc-wait</command> command will wait for a specific
	state change and exit. This is useful for scripting to
	synchronize the launch of a container or the end. The
	parameter is an ORed combination of different states. The
	following example shows how to wait for a container if it successfully
	started as a daemon.

	<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
	  # launch lxc-wait in background
	  lxc-wait -n foo -s STOPPED &
	  LXC_WAIT_PID=$!

	  # this command goes in background
	  lxc-execute -n foo mydaemon &

	  # block until the lxc-wait exits
	  # and lxc-wait exits when the container
	  # is STOPPED
	  wait $LXC_WAIT_PID
	  echo "'foo' is finished"
]]>
	</programlisting>
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>cgroup settings for containers</title>
      <para>
	The container is tied with the control groups, when a container is
	started a control group is created and associated with it. The control
	group properties can be read and modified when the container is running
	by using the lxc-cgroup command.
      </para>
      <para>
	<command>lxc-cgroup</command> command is used to set or get a
	control group subsystem which is associated with a
	container. The subsystem name is handled by the user, the
	command won't do any syntax checking on the subsystem name, if
	the subsystem name does not exists, the command will fail.
      </para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-cgroup -n foo cpuset.cpus
	</programlisting>
	will display the content of this subsystem.
	<programlisting>
	  lxc-cgroup -n foo cpu.shares 512
	</programlisting>
	will set the subsystem to the specified value.
      </para>
