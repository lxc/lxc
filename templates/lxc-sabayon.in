### with a few add on commands add the Sabayon Linux Overlays. 
## migh needs draw my insipration from these too. https://github.com/adrienthebo/sabayon-chroot-builder
### goals an easy to Install Sabayon Linux Builder conainer, which is Gentoo Comapatable , 
#### yet faster to update & administrate... and or a GP Sabayon box sutable for a server farm LXC Virtual hosting... 
###  Requires Gentoo, lxc-gentoo.in run gentoo then these few conversions ####
Include lxc-gentoo.in
emerge --sync
### wait till fin Sync portage source tree 
sleep=n # wait x  .... ???
emerge --buildpkg  sys-apps/entropy sys-apps/file[python] layman equo eix
## Adds Sabayon EQUO && Entropy , layman too eix.
## we'll do this incase entropy and EQUO Fry out one can add pkg via emerge which in some cases has bit me in the ass before..

sleep=n # wait x  .... ???
layman -L 
sleep=45  # wait takes about 45-60 secounds to pull at worst. 
## gent List of overlays --Sync to Db locally , 
layman -f -a sabayon sabayon-distro 
### Add sabayon src repos incase we need to build., also adds package masks etc to keep bad stuff from buuilding that dont agree with Sabayon. 
 equo update && equo repo mirrorsort sabayonlinux.org
## update binaries package lists and repos Sort repos else you'll have GARR.. 
## (university) in IT,  sort to fastests mirrors posible so updates are fast as posible. 
equo rescue spmsync 
sleep=600   # wait takes about 30 mins on a rescued gentoo/sab box however new box shouldn't take long. 
### not always nessisary but since migrating... sync world to entropy DB. ###
equo install entropy equo
## update entropy core  and equo entropy txt client 
equo upgrade
wait till exit ??? 
equo deptest && equo libtest  ### tests dependancies and libs installs if required 
wait till exit ??? 
equo conf update   ### ???? some means of saying -5 to all (YES merge)
