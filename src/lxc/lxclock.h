 * will be placed in \c l->u.sem.
 *
 * If \ref lxcpath and \ref name are given (both must be given if either is
 * given) then a lockfile is created as \c $lxcpath/$lxcname/locks/$name.
 * The lock is used to protect the containers on-disk representation.
 *
 * \internal This function allocates the pathname for the given lock in memory
 * such that it can be can quickly opened and locked by \ref lxclock().
 * \c l->u.f.fname will contain the malloc'ed name (which must be
 * freed when the container is freed), and \c u.f.fd = -1.
