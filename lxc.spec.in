%description

The package "%{name}" provides the command lines to create and manage
containers.  It contains a full featured container with the isolation
/ virtualization of the pids, the ipc, the utsname, the mount points,
/proc, /sys, the network and it takes into account the control groups.
It is very light, flexible, and provides a set of tools around the
container like the monitoring with asynchronous events notification,
or the freeze of the container. This package is useful to create
Virtual Private Server, or to run isolated applications like bash or
sshd.
